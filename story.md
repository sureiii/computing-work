# a cheesy love story 

*Renee POV* 

  His brown, chocolate eyes, the way he sweeps his hair to the side and his laugh... 
I swear, he is going to be the death of me. 

How can one be so perfect? 
He is so nice, funny, smart and kind. 
What is this boy doing to me? 
How can one be so... *perfect*? 
He is so funny, smart and kind. 
*What is this boy doing to me?* 
I have never fallen this hard before... 
He must really have a huge effect on me.

  "Renee? Are you still there?" Jackson questioned.

  "Sorry, spaced out for a moment," I replied. 
That was close. 
I should probably pay attention instead of thinking of him. 
But how could I?
 

*Jackson POV* 

  She is so focused, the way she scrunches her eyes as she thinks of ideas for our project, and her tiny giggles whenever I crack a lame joke. 
The way she is constantly deep in thought and constantly asks these deep questions,
all those traits just maker her seem... *perfect* 
I am so thankful that the teacher paired us together for this project, this way, I get to talk to her more. 
She is really pretty too... 
I cannot comprehend her inner *and* outer beauty. 
I am falling so hard for this girl... 
*What is this girl doing to me?* 

*Renee POV* 

  After school, while walking to the train station, I was lost in my sea of thoughts. 
"Hey," a voice came from behind me, followed by a tap on my shoulder. 
Turning around, I realised it was him, Jackson, the guy I am head over heels for. 

  "So..." Jackson started. "Do you know what kind of guys and food that Jessica likes? I mean, she's you're best friend after all." 
Upon hearing those words, my heart shattered into a million pieces. 
He likes my best friend, not me... 
I guess this is where everything in life goes downhill just like those in the books that I read.

  "Yeah, she likes tall and witty guys. Her favourite food is probably cake, especially matcha," I lied, hoping that he would fall for it. 

  "Oh, okay, thanks, Renee! Bye!" Jackson replied with a smile. 
I could obviously hear the tinge of sadness in his voice. 
He probably thought that he did not classify as a guy that Jessica would like. 
Maybe I should give up on this stupid crush. 
But how could I, he has everything I want in a guy. 
The fact that I cannot get him makes me like him even more. 
Why am I reacting this way? 
I should probably tell Jessica that Jackson likes her. 

*Jackson POV* 

  I regret asking her that question but I had to, if not she would think that I like her. 
I doubt that she would like a guy like me... 
I have annoyed her multiple of times and given her dozens of montone replies to her texts. 
But she will not return my feelings back anyways... 
At least I got to talk to her and hear her voice one more time before the day ends.
Wait, I was going to do something, what was it, what was it... 
Right, I have to ask Jessica if Renee likes me back. 
I am pretty sure she will say that Renee does not like me back. 
Tomorrow, I will meet up with Jessica, buy her a matcha cake and ask her the question. 
I am so nervous... Wish me luck. 

*Renee POV* 

  "Jessie, I've got some news to tell you. Whether it's good or bad is really up to you," I started. 
"Jackson has a crush on you. I think he would uh confess to you soon?" 
I sound too hesitant, she is not going to believe me. 

"But isn't he your crush? 
I thought you weren't over him yet? 
How do you feel about this? 
Should I stop takling to him? 
This is obviously bad news oh my gosh. 
Are you heartbroken by this?
Do you want to eat ice cream? 
Will that make you feel better..." Jessica basically blurted out. 
What did I do to deserve a friend like her. 
No wonder he likes her. 
I get it now. 
Maybe I should start acting like her. 
This way, he would notice me and like me too. 
No, that is a really terrible way to get him to like me, he would definitely be able to tell that I am trying to get his attention.  
In repsonse to Jessica's question, I simply said that I was fine and told her not to worry about it. 

*Jessica POV*

Renee seems so heartbroken... 
The light in her eyes has faded. I can't stand seeing her in this state.
I know Jackson does not like me but it pains me not being able to tell Renee the truth. 
I've got to make them get together, somehow.

The next day...

*Jackson POV* 

Today is the day where I ask Jessica who Renee likes... 
I do hope that it is me but... there is nothing about me to like about. Why would Renee even like someone like me?

*Narrator* 

Jackson and Jessica went to the cafe after school. 

*Jessica POV*

"Hey... so, this is about Renee isn't it?"
Upon hearing my words, Jackson looked up, startled. Did he really think no one would notice?

*Jackson POV*

"H-how did you know?"
I was relieved that I did not have to explain myself to Jessica, but I was still clueless as to how she knew what I was about to say. 
Shaking off those thoughts, I decided to jump straight into what I came here for.
"So, Jessica, by any chance, do you know who Renee likes? I mean, totally not because I'm interested or anything-" 
I paused mid-sentence.
I could feel the heat rising to my cheeks. 
Was that too obvious?

*Jessica POV*

I let out a small chuckle. 
This guy, he really is serious about Renee. 
Well fortunately for them both, they will definitely have no problem in getting together. 
"Don't worry, that girl is crazy over you too," I said, looking directly at him in the eye with a smirk.

*Renee POV*

Lost in my thoughts about Jackson, I stumbled upon a cozy cafe. 
"It wouldn't hurt to spoil myself for now, would it?"
I smiled to myself, before I realised something.
Jessica.
With Jackson.
Eating cake.
Laughing together.
I stopped thinking for a moment. 
I shouldn't be angry. 
Jessica's my best friend. 
I should be happy for her.
Nevermind, I was never in the picture anyways, I should just leave before my emotions get the better of me. 
However, I just stood there, my legs refusing to move. 
Torturing myself to watch that scene. 
Hot tears flowed down my cheeks. 
Why am I crying? 
Do I really like him that much? 
Why is it every time I want to comfort myself, soemthing bad just has to happen.
Wiping my tears, I dashed out of the café.

*Jackson POV* 

After assuring me that Renee felt the same way I did, Jessica shared different stories about Renee, causing both of us to crack up. 
These embarrassing stories of Renee just make her seem even more perfect than ever. 
Suddenly, from the corner my eye, I saw a figure standing by the door of the café. 
She looks vaguely familiar... Have I seen her before? 
She stood facing my directon. 
She wiped her face and dashed out of the café. 
Wait a minute... 
THAT'S RENEE. 
OH NO I MESSED UP BIG TIME.

"Jessica, I think I just saw Renee. I've got to go."

"Renee! Renee!" I desperately tried to call out. 
She was sitting at a bench in the park, curled up in a ball. 
Instinctively, I sat next to her and pulled her close to me. 
"Hey, you don't actually think I like Jessica right?" 
No response. 
"Wait, you belived my lie? I thought it was pretty obvious that I liked you.." 
She shot up, getting out of my grip. 
"What did you say?" 
"That you believed my lie?" 
"No, after that." 
"That it was obvious that I like you?" 
"You like me? How? I'm just a nobo-"
